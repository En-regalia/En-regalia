- 👋 Hi, I’m @En-regalia
- 👀 I’m interested in a worryingly wide variety of things. That's mostly a lie as I'm a keen gamer (PC & console) if that's even an issue these days. I just want to play things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning further detail around the software development life cycle. Software career is on the horizen!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, unless you want to practice your coaching skills, I'm not going to add huge ammounts of value.
- 📫 How to reach me mike.ranner1@gmail.com would be a good start
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've got webbed feet! It runs in my family and is also my highest rated Reddit comment. It also accidentally lead to me being a mod for a webbed feet porn Subredit before I realised what had happeend and promptly deleted. the content was... concerning.

If anyone reading this is keen on sharing some knowledge or is keen on helping me start my career I'd be more than happy to contact. Obs in more of a mentor situation not expecting anyone to do the work for me!
